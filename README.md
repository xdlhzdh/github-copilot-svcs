## Quickstart with Makefile

If you have `make` installed, you can build, run, and test the project easily:

```bash
make build      # Build the binary
make run        # Start the proxy server
make test       # Run unit tests
make test-all   # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Generate coverage report
make clean      # Remove the binary
make lint       # Run linting
make fmt        # Format code
make vet        # Run go vet
make security   # Run security analysis
make docker-build       # Build Docker image
make docker-run         # Run Docker container
```

## Filtering Allowed Models

You can control which models are available by specifying `allowed_models` in your config file (`config.json`).

Example:
```json
{
  "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o", "claude-3.7-sonnet"]
}
```

- If set, both CLI and REST /v1/models lists are filtered and show a note.
- Proxy requests to /v1/chat/completions will only allow those models, rejecting others with HTTP 400.
- If omitted or set to null, all models are permitted (default behavior).

## Building for Different OS/Architectures

You can build binaries for different platforms using the following Makefile targets:

- `make build-linux-amd64`      Build for Linux amd64
- `make build-linux-arm64`      Build for Linux arm64
- `make build-darwin-amd64`     Build for macOS amd64
- `make build-darwin-arm64`     Build for macOS arm64
- `make build-windows-amd64`    Build for Windows amd64
- `make build-windows-arm64`    Build for Windows arm64

The output binaries will be named accordingly (e.g., `github-copilot-svcs-windows-arm64.exe`).

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run`   | Run the proxy server (default command) |
| `auth`   | Authenticate with GitHub Copilot using device flow |
| `status` | Show detailed authentication and token status |
| `config` | Display current configuration details |
| `models` | List all available AI models |
| `refresh`| Manually force token refresh |
| `version`| Show version information |
| `help`   | Show usage information |

### Enhanced Status Monitoring

The `status` command now provides detailed token information with optional JSON output:

```bash
./github-copilot-svcs status
./github-copilot-svcs status --json  # JSON format output
```

Example output:
```
Configuration file: ~/.local/share/github-copilot-svcs/config.json
Port: 8081
Authentication: ✓ Authenticated
Token expires: in 29m 53s (1793 seconds)
Status: ✅ Token is healthy
Has GitHub token: true
Refresh interval: 1500 seconds
```

Status indicators:
- ✅ **Token is healthy**: Token has plenty of time remaining
- ⚠️ **Token will be refreshed soon**: Token is approaching refresh threshold
- ❌ **Token needs refresh**: Token has expired or will expire very soon

## API Endpoints

Once running, the proxy exposes these OpenAI-compatible endpoints:

### Chat Completions
```bash
POST http://localhost:8081/v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 100
}
```

### Completions
This endpoint is OpenAI-compatible and proxies requests to the upstream Copilot API `/completions` endpoint.

```bash
POST http://localhost:8081/v1/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "prompt": "Write a hello world in Python",
  "max_tokens": 100
}
```

### Available Models
```bash
GET http://localhost:8081/v1/models
```

### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:8081/health
```

### Profiling Endpoints (Production Monitoring)
```bash
GET http://localhost:8081/debug/pprof/          # Overview of available profiles
GET http://localhost:8081/debug/pprof/heap      # Memory heap profile
GET http://localhost:8081/debug/pprof/goroutine # Goroutine profile
GET http://localhost:8081/debug/pprof/profile   # CPU profile (30s sampling)
GET http://localhost:8081/debug/pprof/trace     # Execution trace
```

## Reliability & Error Handling

### Automatic Token Management

The proxy implements proactive token management to minimize authentication interruptions:

- **Proactive Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed when 20% of their lifetime remains (typically 5-6 minutes before expiration for 25-minute tokens)
- **Retry Logic**: Failed token refreshes are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff (2s, 8s, 18s delays)
- **Fallback Authentication**: If token refresh fails completely, the system falls back to full device flow re-authentication
- **Background Monitoring**: Token status is continuously monitored during API requests

### Request Retry Logic

Chat completion requests are automatically retried to handle transient failures:

- **Automatic Retries**: Up to 3 attempts for failed requests
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Only retries on network errors, server errors (5xx), rate limiting (429), and timeouts (408)
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry delays of 1s, 4s, 9s to avoid overwhelming the API
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout per request attempt

### Error Recovery

```bash
# Manual token refresh if needed
./github-copilot-svcs refresh

# Check current token status
./github-copilot-svcs status

# Re-authenticate if all else fails
./github-copilot-svcs auth
```

**Streaming Support**: The service is optimized for long-running streaming chat completions with timeouts up to 300 seconds (5 minutes) to support extended AI conversations.

**Custom Configuration**: You can copy `config.example.json` as a starting point and modify timeout values based on your environment:

```bash
cp config.example.json ~/.local/share/github-copilot-svcs/config.json
# Edit the timeouts section as needed
```

## Authentication Flow

The authentication follows GitHub Copilot's OAuth device flow:

1. **Device Authorization**: Generates a device code and user code
2. **User Authorization**: User visits GitHub and enters the user code
3. **Token Exchange**: Polls for GitHub OAuth token
4. **Copilot Token**: Exchanges GitHub token for Copilot API token
5. **Automatic Refresh**: Refreshes Copilot token as needed

## Model Mapping

The proxy automatically maps common model names to GitHub Copilot models:

| Input Model | GitHub Copilot Model | Provider |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-5` | As specified | OpenAI |
| `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini` | As specified | OpenAI |
| `claude-3.5-sonnet`, `claude-3.7-sonnet`, `claude-3.7-sonnet-thought` | As specified | Anthropic |
| `claude-opus-4`, `claude-sonnet-4` | As specified | Anthropic |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash-001` | As specified | Google |

**Supported Model Categories:**
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, O3/O4 reasoning models
- **Anthropic Claude Models**: Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet variants, Claude Opus/Sonnet 4
